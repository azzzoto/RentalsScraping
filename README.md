# RentalsScraping

This repo has the goal of scraping the italian real estate market for Flat Rentals.
This is due to the fact that in the last couple of years it has become very difficult to rent a two-room flat in every region of Italy and most of the times, speed is the key.
For this reason i'm tring to code a telegram bot which can send a notification everytime a new flat is found in the city you're searching a room for.
